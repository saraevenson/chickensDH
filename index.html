        <p> I started my flock with 16 chicks.</p>
        <p> They were a mix of Silver Spangled Hamburgs, Dominiques, Dorkings, and Crested Polish.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.meyerhatchery.com/">I purchased the day-old chicks from Meyer Hatchery</a> and they arrived in the mail!<p>
        <p> Over the past three years, our flax has waxed and waned as hens went broody and hatched clutches, and foxes had uninvited feasts.</p>
        <p> We peaked with 26 birds during the summer of 2019, which was <b>too many</b>!
        <p> We now have 6 hens living in our backyard run.</p>
